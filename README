Progress Updates:
*********************
1) We implemented all of the database operations in the util package.
	a) Not all tables require all CRUD operations. Some records are not
	updatable. 
	b) Some util classes have overridden methods that select rows from
	the database through different coulmns. 
	c) Every *Util class extends DatabaseConnector, which in turns extends the 
	abstract class DatabaseConnectorBase. It is responsible for opening
	and closing the connection. It also implements the DatabaseConstants 
	interface.
	d) All of the util methods are tested and working as expected.
2) We set up a server with MySQL running.
	a) We created a database and all the tables in our Database Schema.
	b) We populated the tables with some dummy data. 
3) We can now remotely connect to our database and populate our pages using
the contents in the database. 
	a) All of the pages now have real data (well...real fake data) from the
	actual database in our server.
4) We are able to login through the login page as admins or users through
accounts stored in corresponding tables.
	a) The contents of the page are dynamically created and populated.
	As an example, if you log in as a user, you will not see the "Add Course"
	button in the ListCourses page since that is an administrator feature. 
5) As requested, we created a diagram showing the relationships among the
tables in the MySQL database. 
	a) Note that the Users table is duplicated in the diagram for aesthetic
	reasons. The actual database only contains one Users table.

*******************
Setup:
*******************
1) The project files are self-contained and no additional setup is necessary
once the project is imported into Android Studio.
2) The project should be emulated using a Nexus 7 (1200x1920) tablet.
3) To login as a user, one can use the following credentials:
	username: yao
	password: user
4) To login as an admin, one can use the following credentials:
	username: yao
	password: admin
